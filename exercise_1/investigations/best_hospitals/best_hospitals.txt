
For finding best hospitals, I combined the scores based on effective care, readmissions and surveys. Each score was weighted with survey score contributing 50% to the total score and effective care and readmissions contibuting 30% and 20% respectively. I decided to weigh patient survey response higher since it usualy reflects the overall experience including the procedure and personal care.

The total survey score was calculated by adding up all the response score. Providers with even a single response missing were removed from the result set. The reason being a missing data point could mean either the procedure was not provided by the provider or there were very few samples to make any meaningful conclusion.

The total readmission score was calculated by summing the individual measure score and the "compared_to_national" score. 
Providers with fewer than 5 measure scores reported are excluded form the result set.

"Compared_to_national" score was encoded as follows

CASE
	WHEN lower(compared_to_national) == "better than the national rate" THEN 10
	WHEN lower(compared_to_national) == "no different than the national rate" THEN 5 
	WHEN lower(compared_to_national) == "worse than the national rate" THEN 1
	WHEN lower(compared_to_national) == "number of cases too small" THEN -1
	WHEN lower(compared_to_national) == "not available" THEN -1
	ELSE -1
END 


The total effective care score is calculated by summing individual condition score like "Emergency Department" , "Heart Attack or Chest Pain" etc.
The condition score is calculated by summing the scores for measures for each condition.
Conditions with even single missing score were excluded from result set and providers with less then 7 condition score were excluded form the ranking
